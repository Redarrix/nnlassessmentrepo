# Design Challenge

Using the [mtcars](/mtcars.csv) dataset, produce two different designs to show how you would present the data on a page in a web application. 
* Designs can be UML or other markup.
* Designs can be hand drawn.
* Designs should be added to this folder of the repository.
* Add a brief description of your designs below.

# Descriptions

## Design 1
Design 1 is a simple but effective table based design for present the data of the .csv file. The page offers the ability to sort the table by pressing on the headers to sort in ascending or descending order. You can also use the search function to find entries matching certain specifications. On the top right, you can select the amount of entries per page as well as change pages.

## Design 2
Design 2 is more designed to present the data of the .csv file similar to an online catalogue. All of the models are listed on a single page and clicking on one will produce a drop down menu with all the information for that entry. The search functionality remains.
