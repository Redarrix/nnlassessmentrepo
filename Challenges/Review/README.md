# Develop Challenge

This challenge is to review the code in the event logger application.

# Requirements

Review the code in the Logger.cs class and suggest any ammendments you feel should be made to improve the code. Fill in your suggestions and reasoning below.

| Line(s) | Suggested Change | Reasoning |
|---------|------------------|-----------|
|  53-55  | Remove the Dispose() function | Seems unnecessary |

I apologize for a lack of suggestions, I am mostly unfamiliar with C# as I was not taught it at university. I do recognise the similarities to Java and am eager to learn more about C# though.
